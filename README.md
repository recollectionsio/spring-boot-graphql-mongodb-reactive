# spring-boot-graphql-mongodb-reactive
Demo project using Webflux Spring Boot GraphQL with MongoDB Reactive

You'll need a MongoDB instance running on localhost at the default port of 27017.
Create a database 'greetings' and a collection 'greeting' within the database.
Import the data found in src/main/resources/data/greetings.json into the 'greeting' table.

Now you should be able to run the project and execute the simple commands found in the GraphQL schema at src/main/resources/graphql/schema.graphqls.
